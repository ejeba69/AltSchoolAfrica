        <article>

            Hey there, my name is <b>Emmanuel</b>. I'm a
            <b>hardcore petrolhead</b>!
          </p>

          <!-- <p>talk about your passionate nature and other attributes. consult the about page of your ebook and your motorsport cv</p> -->
          <p>
            However, The most significant attribute I have discovered about
            myself is that, I am Passion-driven. Passion is my fuel for
            assiduity. Passion also induces focus and determination in me.
          </p>

          <p id="par-ideas">
            Another valuable discovery is that I have a flair for conceiving and
            developing ideas.
            <img
              id="horizon-img"
              src="./img/331-536x354.jpg"
              alt="Photo of someone staring into the horizon."
            />
            Furthermore, I am conscientious. I love to dedicate myself to solve
            a problem as carefully and exhaustively as I can.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a result, I have a preference for embarking on adventurous
            projects that entails imagination and improvisation. One of such
            projects is my eBook "Fresh Ideas"
          </p>

          <p class="par-curious">
            Now, I've always been curious about the "internal mechanism" of
            computer systems,
            <!-- <img src="./circuit.jpeg" alt="electronic circuit" width="4" /> -->
            especially how the software which cannot be described as matter,
            interfaces with what we can see and touch (i.e. the hardware). I
            knew at some point in my life, I would satisfy that curiousity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nonetheless, I got an exciting exposure to the "behind-the-scenes"
            of the internet, sometime in 2020, when I had the need to create a
            website for my motor racing eBook, "Fresh Ideas".
          </p>

          <p>
            Ever since, things have not been the same for me, as I became bitten
            by the bug to learn more about the technical aspect of computers and
            the internet.
          </p>

          <p>
            The more I learnt, the more hungry I became for more technical
            knowledge. I started out with WordPress, but it was a bit
            overwhelming for me. So I tried out the Shopify platform.
          </p>

          <p>
            Notwithstanding, cost considerations drove me back to WordPress.
            Eventually, I managed to set up a descent WordPress website for my
            eBook.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even so<!-- ***//yet*** -->, I wasn't completely satisfied with the
            plugin ecosystem of WordPress. I wanted<!--***//craved for***-->
            more design freedom<!--***//, control***-->
            and flexibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            My first taste of that freedom, was not from a proper programming
            language, but from html. You see, I would occasionally struggle with
            using the text editor on WordPress dashboard of my website.
            <!--***//talk about how the html alternative to that text editor solved it***-->
          </p>

          <p>
            My goal at AltSchool is to become a
            <b>proficient backend engineer</b>.
